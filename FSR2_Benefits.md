### Benefits of Free Software Revolution 2.0

Although by virtue of Free Software Revolution 1.0 (FSR1), users have the source code of many of the basic components of existing social media apps and services, to recreate or clone them is not technically impossible, yet it is actually impossible to do it within a practical timeline. The obstacles include:

1. Saturation of services: No one is going to go through the hassle of creating yet another user account for a new service whose future is unknown and yet has only a fraction of features of the established apps and services.
 
  - Without a substantial number of users willing to test drive a development project, it will never be ready for prime time.
  - In order to address this problem, we need to overcome the fundamental concept of user identity with an ID-less messaging protocol:    
    - [ Phos ID-less Messaging Protocol ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosPay/blob/master/PhosPay_Step_1.md)


2. Fragmentation of programmers due to programming languages:
  - One of the many obstacles project owners of open source repositories are facing is fragmentation of programmers due to programming languages. This causes the difficulties in recruiting sufficient number of collaborators for each project and the cumulative effect of this problem is cannot be underestimated.
  - [ Phos Stack Machine Shell (Shellet) ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosCloudless/blob/master/Phos_Imgui.md) is a Forth like shell that can be implemented in all known programming languages, thus making it a universal script that can be deployed across all cloud computing platforms. Phos script simplifies and revolutionizes learning of programming and mathematics with a novel ___"one word at a time"___ approach based on Reverse Polish Notation, making programming and mathematics more accessible to a much greater and younger population. Shellet refers to a shell embedded within a program (hence the "&ast;-let" suffix) derived from the minimalist Forth architecture.

  - Next step is to recruit project owners to use Phos. Reward with Earn Money as You Learn.
  - Highlight YAHUDI can be used to interface any programming language to Phos
  - YAHUDI (cause) helps recruitment and training of new programmers for open source projects (effect).
  - [ YAHUDI: Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosCloudless/blob/master/YAHUDI_PSN_FSR2.md#yahudi-yet-another-hybrid-upstream-downstream-interface)
  - https://github.com/udexon/PhosCloudless/blob/master/IDSLP.md#shellet-a-shell-embedded-within-a-program

- __Old guards__:

Unlike the initial free software movement, today we need to fight the establishment &ndash; old guards .... Descendants and proponents of old software.

Use learners as developers, one word at a time, Earn Money as You Learn. ID-less system. PhosPay as incentive to learn and develop at the same time.

Add ageism here.


3.  Users are not free to modify the features and code of social media apps or other software.

- [ Live Editing An App & Service ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosCloudless/blob/master/YAHUDI_PSN_FSR2.md#a-new-class-struggle-live-editing-an-app--service)

Shellet programming (SHLP) == YAHUDI + Live Edit


4. Ownership of data, code and device:

data (ID-less), code (Shellet Programming) and device (ID-less + SHLP => can use own device, else useless)

- absolute privacy due to ownership of storage device, execution code and encrypted  data using decentralized ID-less messaging based on asymmetric cryptography

- Proletariat Social Networks

- Phos Cloudless Computing Platform

We further consider a Cloudless Computing Platform.

Cloudless vs. cloud. Like Linux cloning Unix.

- Vision and Action

Vision is Proletariat Social Networks, Phos Cloudless Computing Platform. 

Actions are free software Revolution 2.0: that users can modify live + ID-less messaging. 



#### 1.1 ID-less Messaging & Cloudless Computing

Existing cloud computing services rely on centralized identity management for coordination and messaging. Our ID-less messaging system enables decentralized coordination as well as bridging amongst existing cloud infrastructure, resulting in Cloudless Computing.

This leads to truly untraceable anonymous communications, which can further enhance exchanges of cryptocurrencies, national currencies and bullions, finally bringing cryptocurrencies to 99% of the masses.


#### 2.1 YAHUDI == One Word at A Time

YAHUDI == Static. Live Edit == Dynamic modification of code.

Still need experienced programmers to write Phos words for their programs, then only beginners can learn. 

Experienced programmers can find more collaborators in this way. 

Beginners learn project, not just programming. 

Must write in such a way that both beginners and experts see benefits of Phos. Bridge to mathematics. Everyone wants to know Mathematical truth, but don't know how. Use this as writing theme. 

RPN can be used to represent ideas in metaprogramming. As we write more programs, we develop metaprogramming ideas, but conventional programming languages cannot represent them adequately. The most practical benefits is teamwork: YAHUDI will make it easier to collaborate. 

Appeal to readers, beginners and experts, Free Software 2.0, remaking social networks with FS2?

:: Old model, independent program
:: Jump address of program
:: Program modification

All components of MAGAF are open source. May need to re build missing parts. Or start with projects like Signal. 

Phos Cloudless is the platform that can glue all  open source components, in whatever programming languages, during execution (using Phos messaging) and training new programmers (YAHUDI simplifying learning).

- With all the above, possible to achieve?

- How?

- Highlight YAHUDI as method to recruit collaborators for all project owners.

YAHUDI can overcome this ....

Next step is to recruit project owners to use Phos. Reward with Earn Money as You Learn.


#### 2.2 Benefits to Programmers: Young and Old

__Ageism__

(Ageism is related to programmer fragmentation. Old programmers have more value when fragmentation is overcome.)

:: Ageism // prepend paragraph with word, like colon definition. Then relate paragraphs using labels. Next, lower level of hypertext. Integrate with graph of questions

- Most prospective group to develop Phos would be old programmers, facing age discrimination. 

Transfer knowledge in one programming language to others. Experience in 2 or more programming languages improve employability by a lot. Knowledge in stack machine is fundamental and useful in many applications.

__Lower Barriers__

1 out of 1000 users may have an idea to improve a feature or function or just a colour or icon. Conventional FSR1 allow change of code, but to build and run, barriers too big, involve front end, back end, initializing variables. 

__One word at a time__

Other commercial benefits are derived from the above? Mechanism of transferring user editing code to commercial rewards. Liberating more user productivity by making programming and learning of programming simpler.


#### 2.3 __Metaprogramming__

(Metaprograming high level view of YAHUDI, One Word at A Time, bridge to mathematics and artificial intelligence.)

Programming manipulates data and produce solution in code. Metaprogramming manipulates code. All programmers should progress towards metaprogramming and then mathematics. 

先数后算

Homoiconification: All code can be transformed to homoiconic form from top down. How deep to covert depends on convenience.

同相化 转换为后算式 





#### 3.1 Live Editing of Code while Programs are _IN EXECUTION_

- Freedom for users to modify features and functionalities of front end and back end processes IN EXECUTION down to a single line of code.


Enable on the fly modifications

Beginners concern is learning new words. How? 

Can execute RPN without recompiling. Most important benefits for beginners. Changing code in host programming language is a huge barrier of entry.


:: Old model, independent program

The internet is already huge. Need incremental software development model = shellet. Old model = full independent programs are not counter productive, barriers of entry too big.

:: Jump address of program

Independent programs are not really independent. Just block of instructions with addresses for operating system to jump to.

:: // Use words from paragraph as label
Program modification as a mechanism of class struggle. Existing software model is owner vs. user, user cannot change software.


#### 3.2 Cloning: A Low Hanging Fruit

(Cloning is the result/effect of YAHUDI helping project owners to recruit collaborators, improving the components used for Proletariat Social Network &ndash; ___a network owned by everyone___.)

- Perhaps the fact that GNU Linux and other free software projects cloned the Unix operating system too successfully has resulted in most people forgetting that cloning itself is not much of an innovative exercise. 

While cloning does not diminish the usefulness of GNU Linux and related free software, it also proved that it is possible to cloning commercial systems such as social media systems as free software projects.



#### Notes

Default label to first words of paragraph if unlabeled.

Or, highlight words in paragraph as label.

:: cause & effect, list of causes, list of effects; move finished sentences to front, unfinished at the back.


:: - How to combine multiple issues into one article?

:: List issues, use diagram or graph to show relationship of issues?


:: Explain in detail

:: Paragraph label is one level below section or subsection, which has markdown

:: Summarize the above

:: Compared to FSR1, readers only perceive new ideas based on what they know. If label of paragraph not used, they will not appear in target, hence left as comments. If label appears multiple times, paragraphs are related. Figure out how to relate them.

:: label paragraph with double __ (bold); always copy labels to reorganize them elsewhere

:: How to link previous to next paragraph?

:: indent paragraphs that can later become a section

- :: New class struggle
- Benefits of Free Software Revolution 2.0
- __One word at a time__
- __Lower Barriers__
- __Karl Marx Class Struggle__
- __CLONING__

- :: Old model, independent program
- :: Jump address of program
- :: Program modification

- :: Vision action
- :: Old guards
- :: Ageism
