### Benefits of Free Software Revolution 2.0

Although by virtue of Free Software Revolution 1.0 (FSR1), users have the source code of many of the basic components of existing social media apps and services, to recreate or clone them is not technically impossible, yet impossible to execute within a practical timeline. The obstacles include:

- Saturation of services: No one is going to go through the hassle of creating yet another user account for a new service whose future is unknown and yet has only a fraction of features of the established apps and services.
 
  - Without a substantial number of users willing to test drive a development project, it will never be ready for prime time.
  
  - In order to address this problem, we need to overcome the fundamental concept of user identity with an ID-less messaging protocol:
    - [ Phos ID-less Messaging Protocol ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosPay/blob/master/PhosPay_Step_1.md)

- [ Phos Stack Machine Shell (Shellet) ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosCloudless/blob/master/Phos_Imgui.md) is a Forth like shell that can be implemented in all known programming languages, thus making it a universal script that can be deployed across all cloud computing platforms. Phos script simplifies and revolutionizes learning of programming and mathematics with a novel "one word at a time" approach based on Reverse Polish Notation, making programming and mathematics more accessible to a much greater and younger population. Shellet refers to a shell embedded within a program (hence the "&ast;-let" suffix) derived from the minimalist Forth architecture.

- One of the many obstacles project owners of open source repositories are facing is fragmentation of programmers due to programming languages.
  - Next step is to recruit project owners to use Phos. Reward with Earn Money as You Learn.
  - https://github.com/udexon/PhosCloudless/blob/master/IDSLP.md#shellet-a-shell-embedded-within-a-program

- Use learners as developers, one word at a time, Earn Money as You Learn. ID-less system.


__Lower Barriers__

1 out of 1000 users may have an idea to improve a feature or function or just a colour or icon. Conventional FSR1 allow change of code, but to build and run, barriers too big, involve front end, back end, initializing variables. 

__One word at a time__

Other commercial benefits are derived from the above? Mechanism of transferring user editing code to commercial rewards. Liberating more user productivity by making programming and learning of programming simpler.

:: Summarize the above

:: Compared to FSR1, readers only perceive new ideas based on what they know. If label of paragraph not used, they will not appear in target, hence left as comments. If label appears multiple times, paragraphs are related. Figure out how to relate them.


#### Phos Cloudless Computing Platform

[ Phos ID-less Messaging Protocol ]()

We further consider a Cloudless Computing Platform.

Cloudless vs. cloud. Like Linux cloning Unix.

:: label paragraph with double __ (bold); always copy labels to reorganize them elsewhere


#### Cloning: A Low Hanging Fruit

- Perhaps the fact that GNU Linux and other free software projects cloned the Unix operating system too successfully has resulted in most people forgetting that cloning itself is not much of an innovative exercise. 

While cloning does not diminish the usefulness of GNU Linux and related free software, it also proved that it is possible to cloning commercial systems such as social media systems as free software projects.

All components of MAGAF are open source. May need to re build missing parts. Or start with projects like Signal. 

Phos Cloudless is the platform that can glue all  open source components, in whatever programming languages, during execution (using Phos messaging) and training new programmers (YAHUDI simplifying learning).

- With all the above, possible to achieve?

- How?

- Highlight YAHUDI as method to recruit collaborators for all project owners.

YAHUDI can overcome this ....


:: How to link previous to next paragraph?

:: indent paragraphs that can later become a section

Next step is to recruit project owners to use Phos. Reward with Earn Money as You Learn.


__Metaprogramming__

Programming manipulates data and produce solution in code. Metaprogramming manipulates code. All programmers should progress towards metaprogramming and then mathematics. 

:: Vision action

Vision and action. Vision is free software that users can modify live. Action is ID-less messaging. 

:: Old guards

Unlike the initial free software movement, today we need to fight the establishment -- old guards .... Descendants and proponents of old software.


__Ageism__

:: Ageism // prepend paragraph with word, like colon definition. Then relate paragraphs using labels. Next, lower level of hypertext. Integrate with graph of questions

- Most prospective group to develop Phos would be old programmers, facing age discrimination. 

Transfer knowledge in one programming language to others. Experience in 2 or more programming languages improve employability by a lot. Knowledge in stack machine is fundamental and useful in many applications.

先数后算

Homoiconification: All code can be transformed to homoiconic form from top down. How deep to covert depends on convenience.

同相化 转换为后算式 

Enable on the fly modifications

Beginners concern is learning new words. How? 

Can execute RPN without recompiling. Most important benefits for beginners. Changing code in host programming language is a huge barrier of entry.

Still need experienced programmers to write Phos words for their programs, then only beginners can learn. 

Experienced programmers can find more collaborators in this way. 

Beginners learn project, not just programming. 

Must write in such a way that both beginners and experts see benefits of Phos. Bridge to mathematics. Everyone wants to know Mathematical truth, but don't know how. Use this as writing theme. 

RPN can be used to represent ideas in metaprogramming. As we write more programs, we develop metaprogramming ideas, but conventional programming languages cannot represent them adequately. The most practical benefits is teamwork: YAHUDI will make it easier to collaborate. 

Appeal to readers, beginners and experts, Free Software 2.0, remaking social networks with FS2?


:: Old model, independent program
:: Jump address of program
:: Program modification

:: Old model, independent program

The internet is already huge. Need incremental software development model = shellet. Old model = full independent programs are not counter productive, barriers of entry too big.

:: Jump address of program

Independent programs are not really independent. Just block of instructions with addresses for operating system to jump to.

:: // Use words from paragraph as label
Program modification as a mechanism of class struggle. Existing software model is owner vs. user, user cannot change software.

Default label to first words of paragraph if unlabeled.

Or, highlight words in paragraph as label.

:: cause & effect, list of causes, list of effects; move finished sentences to front, unfinished at the back.


:: - How to combine multiple issues into one article?

:: List issues, use diagram or graph to show relationship of issues?


:: Explain in detail

:: Paragraph label is one level below section or subsection, which has markdown
