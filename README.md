### Phos Cloudless Computing

- [ Phos Stack Machine Shell: ](https://github.com/udexon/Homoiconism/blob/master/Q23_Phos_Smashlet.md) A programmable shell using a universal interface script based on Forth like Reverse Polish Notation, hosted within a program, written in any known high level programming language. 
- [ Datong Token: ](https://github.com/udexon/DatongToken/blob/master/Datong_Token_Overview.md) A breakthrough in public key encryption infrastructure, enabling users to create impromptu password without centralized control. As such, this leads to truly untraceable anonymous communications, which can further enhance exchanges of cryptocurrencies, national currencies and bullions, finally bringing cryptocurrencies to 99% of the masses.
- [ Earn Money as You Learn: ](https://github.com/udexon/EMYL) A CLOUDLESS Open Source Platform to Learn Programming, One Word At A Time, using Forth like Reverse Polish Notation, rewarded with Cryptocurrencies.

CLOUDLESS Computing will replace Cloud Computing as the next driver of growth for computing industries, as mobile devices increasingly acts as server nodes, empowered by ID-less decentralized transactions.

The present Internet and mobile services infrastructure are mainly based on cloud computing, which is in turn built upon virtual machines, both at the front end (Android, iOS, web browser) and the back end. Different programming languages and centralized identity management are used for the various platforms, resulting in critical bottlenecks of growth.

Phos stack machine shell (Smashlet) is a Forth like shell that can be implemented in all known programming languages, thus making it a universal script that can be deployed across all cloud computing platforms. Phos script simplifies and revolutionizes learning of programming and mathematics with a novel "one word at a time" approach based on Reverse Polish Notation, making programming and mathematics more accessible to a much greater and younger population.

Existing cloud computing services rely on centralized identity management for coordination and messaging. Our ID-less messaging system enables decentralized coordination as well as bridging amongst existing cloud infrastructure, resulting in Cloudless Computing.

Phos Cloudless Computing enables next generation social network applications, such as ID-less cryptocurrencies, Earn Money as You Learn and Gurunet.
