## From Cloudless Computing to Unifying Mathematics and Programming: Kickstarting Free Software Revolution 2.0 with Stack Machine Programming

We define Free Software Revolution 1.0 (FSR1) as the period encompassing the creation of GNU Linux and tools to Google's acquisition of the Android operating system. The mobile computing era, empowered by Android and iOS, saw the rise of tech giants and start-ups worth trillions of USD, as well as cryptocurrencies.

However, in some fundamental ways, the freedom of software development stagnated, as the front end apps and back end services are increasingly dominated by invisible corporate entities, without anyone proposing a viable solution.

If FSR1 was the movement where free software programmers defeated proprietary Unix and server software by essentially cloning them, then Free Software Revolution 2.0 (FSR2) would be a movement where free software programmers and users defeat giant corporations by cloning the former's proprietary social networks, using cloudless computing infrastructure, which is hosted on mobile or fixed line devices owned by the programmers and users themselves. 

We believe FSR2 can be achieved with stack machine programming, one of the oldest secrets in the art of computer programming.

Amongst the various benefits of stack machine programming is the deployment of a Forth like stack machine shell (Smashlet) script across all known programming languages, thus enabling programmers to collaborate more effectively and build components to replace proprietary social networks more easily.

Besides, other factors required to create a "nobody's" ("Proletariat") social network are:

- ID-less messaging
- live editing code in execution
- distributed ownership of device
