### From YAHUDI to Proletariat Social Networks: Free Software Revolution 2.0

The Next Class Struggle

We define Free Software Revolution 1.0 as the period encompassing the creation of GNU Linux and tools to Google's acquisition of the Android operating system. The mobile computing era, empowered by Android and iOS, saw the rise of tech giants and start-ups worth trillions of USD, as well as cryptocurrencies. 

However, in some fundamental ways, the freedom of software development stagnated, as the front end apps and back end services are increasingly dominated by invisible corporate entities, without anyone proposing a viable solution. 

In this project, we propose YAHUDI and Proletariat Social Networks, based on fundamental breakthroughs in employing Forth like Reverse Polish Notation in stack machine shells embedded in programs written in any known programming language, as well as an ID-less messaging system based on asymmetric cryptography, making Cloudless Computing possible.


:: Must describe what is achievement in FSR2, ie. FSR1 is free source code. Must write in plain language people can understand and remember. Blank lines before :: to readability

:: action followed by result/benefit, as above; categorize paragraphs as action or result (cause and effect); for each action/cause identify effect/result, or vice versa.

The benefits of Free Software Revoltuion 2.0 (FSR2) include:

- Freedom for users to modify features and functionalities of front end and back end processes IN EXECUTION down to a single line of code.

- absolute privacy due to ownership of storage device, execution code and encrypted  data using decentralized ID-less messaging based on asymmetric cryptography

:: explain benefits (effects) briefly at introduction. then details. finally explain all benefits


#### YAHUDI

YAHUDI stands for Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface, an Application Programming Interface (API) where the upstream (low level) code is written in a high level programming language (such as Java, JavaScript, C++ etc.) and the downstream (high level) code is written in a Forth like Reverse Polish Notation implementation known as Phos ("light" in Greek).

 It contrasts with conventional API where the caller and callee are usually written in the same programming language. In cases where the upstream code is written in C/C++ but the downstream code are in respective programming languages e.g. Python, Java, they are divergent, as they have a common upstream but different downstreams, figuratively represented as an inverted Y. 

In YAHUDI, the upstream programming languages are different while the downstream programming language is Phos, hence convergence, represented by the letter Y, hence YAHUDI.




Existing cloud computing services rely on centralized identity management for coordination and messaging. Our ID-less messaging system enables decentralized coordination as well as bridging amongst existing cloud infrastructure, resulting in Cloudless Computing.

 this leads to truly untraceable anonymous communications, which can further enhance exchanges of cryptocurrencies, national currencies and bullions, finally bringing cryptocurrencies to 99% of the masses.



#### Ecosystem of Programming Languages and Division of Labour

In today's programming ecosystem, the lowest level or upstream functions are usually written in C/C++, or more precisely, compiled using GNU C/C++ or other equivalent open source compilers. 

An Application Programming Interface (API) specifies how a caller function should be written, together with a specific number and types of parameters. Usually, the caller and callee functions are written in the same programming language. In some cases, the callee function is in C/C++, while the caller programming language would be in another language such as Python or Java.

In the case of C/C++ as the caller, the callee might be written in assembly language of particular microprocessors. 

By division of labor, programmers may specialize in either caller or callee functions. Such division is not apparent usually due to the fact that a single programmer needs to write both the callee and caller code. 

- Is it possible to create a universal caller script? 

The ??? described in the previous section have been the de facto practices, as there has been no novel approach proposed to make the division of labor of programming more efficient.

- What if we can make the division of labor of programming more efficient?


Some programmers may still code directly in assembly language or Forth. 

Illustrate using PhosPay JavaScript and Java.


#### Other Benefits of Free Software Revolution 2.0

Although by virtue of Free Software Revolution 1.0 (FSR1), users have the source code of many of the basic components of existing social media apps and services, to recreate or clone them is not technically impossible, yet impossible to execute within a practical timeline. The obstacles include:

- Saturation of services: No one is going to go through the hassle of creating yet another user account for a new service whose future is unknown and yet has only a fraction of features of the established apps and services.

  - This can be overcome by Phos ID-less Messaging Protocol. 

:: cause & effect, list of causes, list of effects

1 out of 1000 users may have an idea to improve a feature or function or just a colour or icon. Conventional FSR1 allow change of code, but to build and run, barriers too big, involve front end, back end, initializing variables. 

One word at a time.

- Privacy etc. Control of own data … Can audit privacy of message because code is transparent to all

Other commercial benefits are derived from the above? Mechanism of transferring user editing code to commercial rewards. Liberating more user productivity by making programming and learning of programming simpler.

:: Summarize the above

:: Compared to FSR1, readers only perceive new ideas based on what they know. If label of paragraph not used, they will not appear in target, hence left as comments. If label appears multiple times, paragraphs are related. Figure out how to relate them.

:: Ageism
Transfer knowledge in one programming language to others. Experience in 2 or more programming languages improve employability by a lot. Knowledge in stack machine is fundamental and useful in many applications.





Karl Marx could have been a computer scientist for proposing class struggle that can be generalized across vast categories of people. 

Indeed, the free software movement was a class struggle that liberated software users from the tyranny of proprietary Unix systems, by giving them another choice that is completely free, both financially as well as the rights to learn and innovate.

Microsoft former CEO Steve Balmer recognized free software as the biggest threat to Microsoft's hegemony and 
 he infamously accused Linux as Communism.

:: New class struggle
As we enter a new decade in 2020, a new class struggle has emerged: Users are not free to modify the features and code of social media apps or other software. 

Readers may ask,

- Why are we supposed to be free to modify the features and code of social media apps or other software, if they are owned by us?

So in fact, the underlying question is the ownership of the software. More precisely, 

- Who owns the server programs running a social media app? 

Consider an alternative perspective,

- Is it possible to modify a server program without owning it?

[ Phos Shellet Examples ]()

Phos shellet demonstrates that it is possible to modify a client or a server program _WHILE IN EXECUTION_.

So the question boils down to,

- Will the owner of social media server allow users to modify the system using shellet?

In short, we have reduce the technical problem to a business problem.

#### Phos Cloudless Computing Platform

[ Phos ID-less Messaging Protocol ]()

We further consider a Cloudless Computing Platform.

Cloudless vs. cloud. Like Linux cloning Unix.

Perhaps it is not a common knowledge that 

Perhaps the fact that GNU Linux and other free software projects cloned the Unix operating system too successfully has resulted in most people forgetting that cloning itself is not much of an innovative exercise. 

While cloning does not diminish the usefulness of GNU Linux and related free software, it also proved that it is possible to cloning commercial systems such as social media systems as free software projects.

All components of MAGAF are open source. May need to re build missing parts. Or start with projects like Signal. 

Phos Cloudless is the platform that can glue all  open source components, in whatever programming languages, during execution (using Phos messaging) and training new programmers (YAHUDI simplifying learning).

- With all the above, possible to achieve?

- How?

- Highlight YAHUDI as method to recruit collaborators for all project owners.

:: How to link previous to next paragraph?

One of the many obstacles project owners of open source repositories are facing is fragmentation of programmers due to programming languages.

YAHUDI can overcome this ....

Next step is to recruit project owners to use Phos. Reward with Earn Money as You Learn.



:: Explain in detail

Programming manipulates data and produce solution in code. Metaprogramming manipulates code. All programmers should progress towards metaprogramming and then mathematics. 

:: Paragraph label is one level below section or subsection, which has markdown

:: Vision action
Vision and action. Vision is free software that users can modify live. Action is ID-less messaging. 

:: Old guards
Unlike the initial free software movement, today we need to fight the establishment -- old guards .... Descendants and proponents of old software.



:: Ageism // prepend paragraph with word, like colon definition. Then relate paragraphs using labels. Next, lower level of hypertext. Integrate with graph of questions
- Most prospective group might be old programmers, facing age discrimination. 

How to combine multiple issues into one article?

List issues, use diagram or graph to show relationship of issues?



先数后算

Homoiconification: All code can be transformed to homoiconic form from top down. How deep to covert depends on convenience.

同相化 转换为后算式 

Enable on the fly modifications

Beginners concern is learning new words. How? 

Can execute RPN without recompiling. Most important benefits for beginners. Changing code in host programming language is a huge barrier of entry.

Still need experienced programmers to write Phos words for their programs, then only beginners can learn. 

Experienced programmers can find more collaborators in this way. 

Beginners learn project, not just programming. 

Must write in such a way that both beginners and experts see benefits of Phos. Bridge to mathematics. Everyone wants to know Mathematical truth, but don't know how. Use this as writing theme. 

RPN can be used to represent ideas in metaprogramming. As we write more programs, we develop metaprogramming ideas, but conventional programming languages cannot represent them adequately. The most practical benefits is teamwork: YAHUDI will make it easier to collaborate. 

Appeal to readers, beginners and experts, Free Software 2.0, remaking social networks with FS2?


:: Old model, independent program
:: Jump address of program
:: Program modification

:: Old model, independent program
The internet is already huge. Need incremental software development model = shellet. Old model = full independent programs are not counter productive, barriers of entry too big.

:: Jump address of program
Independent programs are not really independent. Just block of instructions with addresses for operating system to jump to.

:: // Use words from paragraph as label
Program modification as a mechanism of class struggle. Existing software model is owner vs. user, user cannot change software.

Default label to first words of paragraph if unlabeled.

Or, highlight words in paragraph as label.
