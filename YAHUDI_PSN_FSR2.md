### From YAHUDI to Proletariat Social Networks: Free Software Revolution 2.0

The Next Class Struggle

We define Free Software Revolution 1.0 as the period encompassing the creation of GNU Linux and tools to Google's acquisition of the Android operating system. The mobile computing era, empowered by Android and iOS, saw the rise of tech giants and start-ups worth trillions of USD, as well as cryptocurrencies. 

However, in some fundamental ways, the freedom of software development stagnated, as the front end apps and back end services are increasingly dominated by invisible corporate entities, without anyone proposing a viable solution. 

In this project, we propose YAHUDI and Proletariat Social Networks, based on fundamental breakthroughs in employing Forth like Reverse Polish Notation in stack machine shells embedded in programs written in any known programming language, as well as an ID-less messaging system based on asymmetric cryptography, making Cloudless Computing possible.


:: Must describe what is achievement in FSR2, ie. FSR1 is free source code. Must write in plain language people can understand and remember. Blank lines before :: to readability

:: action followed by result/benefit, as above; categorize paragraphs as action or result (cause and effect); for each action/cause identify effect/result, or vice versa.

The benefits of Free Software Revoltuion 2.0 (FSR2) include:

- Freedom for users to modify features and functionalities of front end and back end processes IN EXECUTION down to a single line of code.

- absolute privacy due to ownership of storage device, execution code and encrypted  data using decentralized ID-less messaging based on asymmetric cryptography

:: explain benefits (effects) briefly at introduction. then details. finally explain all benefits


#### YAHUDI: Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

YAHUDI stands for Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface, an Application Programming Interface (API) where the upstream (low level) code is written in a high level programming language (such as Java, JavaScript, C++ etc.) and the downstream (high level) code is written in a Forth like Reverse Polish Notation implementation known as Phos ("light" in Greek).

It contrasts with conventional API where the caller and callee are usually written in the same programming language. In cases where the upstream code is written in C/C++ but the downstream code are in respective programming languages e.g. Python, Java, they are divergent, as they have a common upstream but different downstreams, figuratively represented as an inverted Y. 

In YAHUDI, the upstream programming languages are different while the downstream programming language is Phos, hence convergence, represented by the letter Y, hence YAHUDI.


#### ID-less Messaging & Cloudless Computing

Existing cloud computing services rely on centralized identity management for coordination and messaging. Our ID-less messaging system enables decentralized coordination as well as bridging amongst existing cloud infrastructure, resulting in Cloudless Computing.

 this leads to truly untraceable anonymous communications, which can further enhance exchanges of cryptocurrencies, national currencies and bullions, finally bringing cryptocurrencies to 99% of the masses.



#### Ecosystem of Programming Languages and Division of Labour

In today's programming ecosystem, the lowest level or upstream functions are usually written in C/C++, or more precisely, compiled using GNU C/C++ or other equivalent open source compilers. 

An Application Programming Interface (API) specifies how a caller function should be written, together with a specific number and types of parameters. Usually, the caller and callee functions are written in the same programming language. In some cases, the callee function is in C/C++, while the caller programming language would be in another language such as Python or Java.

In the case of C/C++ as the caller, the callee might be written in assembly language of particular microprocessors. 

By division of labor, programmers may specialize in either caller or callee functions. Such division is not apparent usually due to the fact that a single programmer needs to write both the callee and caller code. 

- Is it possible to create a universal caller script? 

The ??? described in the previous section have been the de facto practices, as there has been no novel approach proposed to make the division of labor of programming more efficient.

- What if we can make the division of labor of programming more efficient?


Some programmers may still code directly in assembly language or Forth. 

Illustrate using PhosPay JavaScript and Java.




__Karl Marx Class Struggle__

Karl Marx could have been a computer scientist for proposing class struggle that can be generalized across vast categories of people. 

Indeed, the free software movement was a class struggle that liberated software users from the tyranny of proprietary Unix systems, by giving them another choice that is completely free, both financially as well as the rights to learn and innovate.

Microsoft former CEO Steve Balmer recognized free software as the biggest threat to Microsoft's hegemony and he infamously accused Linux as Communism.

#### A New Class Struggle: Live Editing An App & Service

As we enter a new decade in 2020, a new class struggle has emerged: 
- Users are not free to modify the features and code of social media apps or other software. 

Readers may ask,

- Why are we supposed to be free to modify the features and code of social media apps or other software, if they are owned by us?

So in fact, the underlying question is the ownership of the software. More precisely, 

- Who owns the server programs running a social media app? 

Consider an alternative perspective,

- Is it possible to modify a server program without owning it?

The solution is given here:
- [ Phos Shellet Examples ]()

Phos shellet demonstrates that it is possible to modify a client or a server program _WHILE IN EXECUTION_.

So the question boils down to,

- Will the owner of social media server allow users to modify the system using shellet?

In short, we have reduce the technical problem to a business problem.
