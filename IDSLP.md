### ID-less Shellet Programming: Towards Cloudless Computing
 
 (IDSLP)

We propose perhaps the most significant breakthrough in programming since the invention of the Forth programming language in 1968 and the implementation of asymmetric cryptography in 1973.  

ID-less Shellet Programming (IDSLP) will usher in a new era of CLOUDLESS Computing, replacing Cloud Computing as the next driver of growth for computing industries, as mobile devices increasingly acts as server nodes, empowered by ID-less decentralized transactions.

#### Shellet: a Shell Embedded within a Program

Phos stack machine shell (Smashlet) is a Forth like shell that can be implemented in all known programming languages, thus making it a universal script that can be deployed across all cloud computing platforms. Phos script simplifies and revolutionizes learning of programming and mathematics with a novel "one word at a time" approach based on Reverse Polish Notation, making programming and mathematics more accessible to a much greater and younger population.

Shellet or Smashlet refers to a shell embedded within a program (hence the "&ast;-let" suffix) derived from the minimalist Forth architecture.


#### ID-less Messaging: Maximizing the Possibilities of Asymmetric Cryptography

When asymmetric cryptography was implemented by Clifford Cocks in GCHQ, UK, in 1973, Atari was only a 1 year old company. The world would need to wait for another 2 decades before GNU (!!) Linux  popularized the Unix symmetric cryptographic user ID system.

Then asymmetric cryptography got applied in web browsers around 2000.

Then Bitcoin was invented in 2009. Its market cap in January 2020 is above USD 150 billion, a spectacular achievement by all measures. 

Statista forecast of online games for 2020:

Revenue (2020) +1.2% yoy US$17,141m

Users (2020) +6.1% yoy 877.3m

Yet few understood the significance of asymmetric cryptography as it can basically create a new ID-less world -- a prospect that no government or corporation would welcome. Anarchists worldwide have yet to appreciate its significance and start to work on it earnestly to create a literally Anarchic world.

The differences between an ID-less world and the current managed ID world are literally like post and pre smart phones, to use an analogy that is relevant to most people.  


The first difficulty is to understand the concept theoretically.

Second is how to implement it with novel approach. ID-less authentication is part of Cloudless Computing.

Unix shell invokes program but do not modify variables within program. Smashlet does. `*let` means a small shell within the program. Unix shell is programmable, but its variables have no relationships with the programs it invoke. 

Shell-let, shellet Programming.

GUI programming is also based in graph theory. List of button: position of button is value, clicking it is to invoke, analogous to reverse Polish notation data on stack and operation.

Most profitable use case of IDSLP is to improve existing social media apps and online games. Development of these games are controlled by centralized corporate programmers. No other way. IDSLP allows additional developments by free software programmers or freelance programmers without interruption of existing infrastructure.



Imagine earning one cent for every minute of game playing from one single player. Use Smashlet to reprogram everything. It is like Mr Smith in Matrix. Quite literally. 

New concept of user, interactions with apps, one command at a time.

Conventional notion of Programming is to write a new and independent program. Smashlet is to write a one liner, a list of words. ID-less messaging (IDLM) defines relationships of Smashlet to other smahslets on same or different devices.

#### Benefits of Shellet Programming

One of biggest drawbacks of existing software infrastructure that few have questioned is the artificial barriers between social networks, causing great difficulties for free software programmers or freelancers to improve on the existing features and services.

e.g. No one outside Facebook would be able to write code to improve the Facebook app, although limited APIs for developing applets and other protocols have been published.

ID-less Shellet Programming would circumvent these barriers by changing several fundamental behaviors of network applications. 

Firstly, Shellet Programming (SHLP) departs from the notion of "a programmer writes an independent program", that communicates with other programs via network protocols. Shellet allows third party programmers to directly access and modify the variables and code of a program IN EXECUTION. 

Based on the conventional notion of a program, a programmer would spend a great deal of effort to edit the code and compile it to produce an executable package, e.g. an Android apk. A programmer unrelated to Facebook would require an even greater huge effort to create an independent program that can work with the Facebook app or Facebook server, by incorporating various proprietary APIs. 

Suppose in a hypothetical scenario, the Facebook Android app incorporates a shellet, making it possible for users to access and modify its variables and code. The greatest benefits would be that free software programmers and freelancers would be able to add and improve features to the existing app, benefitting all users. 

However, in reality, it would be quite unlikely for Facebook to adopt shellet for business reasons, even though it is technically trivial to do so. We cite this example so that readers may appreciate the potential benefits of shellet.
