### ID-less Shellet Programming: Towards Cloudless Computing
 
 (IDSLP)

We propose perhaps the most significant breakthrough in programming since the invention of the Forth programming language in 1968 and the implementation of asymmetric cryptography in 1973.  

ID-less Shellet Programming (IDSLP) will usher in a new era of CLOUDLESS Computing, replacing Cloud Computing as the next driver of growth for computing industries, as mobile devices increasingly acts as server nodes, empowered by ID-less decentralized transactions.

#### Shellet: a Shell Embedded within a Program

Phos stack machine shell (Smashlet) is a Forth like shell that can be implemented in all known programming languages, thus making it a universal script that can be deployed across all cloud computing platforms. Phos script simplifies and revolutionizes learning of programming and mathematics with a novel "one word at a time" approach based on Reverse Polish Notation, making programming and mathematics more accessible to a much greater and younger population.

Shellet or Smashlet refers to a shell embedded within a program (hence the "-let" suffix) derived from the minimalist Forth architecture.


#### ID-less Messaging: Maximizing the Possibilities of Asymmetric Cryptography

When asymmetric cryptography was implemented by Clifford Cocks in GCHQ, UK, in 1973, Atari was only a 1 year old company. The world would need to wait for another 2 decades before GNU (!!) Linux  popularized the Unix symmetric cryptographic user ID system.

Then asymmetric cryptography got applied in web browsers around 2000.

Then Bitcoin was invented in 2009. Its market cap in January 2020 is above USD 150 billion, a spectacular achievement by all measures. 

Statista forecast of online games for 2020:

Revenue (2020) +1.2% yoy US$17,141m

Users (2020) +6.1% yoy 877.3m

Yet few understood the significance of asymmetric cryptography as it can basically create a new ID-less world -- a prospect that no government or corporation would welcome. Anarchists worldwide have yet to appreciate its significance and start to work on it earnestly to create a literally Anarchic world.

The differences between an ID-less world and the current managed ID world are literally like post and pre smart phones, to use an analogy that is relevant to most people.  


The first difficulty is to understand the concept theoretically.

Second is how to implement it with novel approach. ID-less authentication is part of Cloudless Computing.

Unix shell invokes program but do not modify variables within program. Smashlet does. `*let` means a small shell within the program. Unix shell is programmable, but its variables have no relationships with the programs it invoke. 

Shell-let, shellet Programming.

GUI programming is also based in graph theory. List of button: position of button is value, clicking it is to invoke, analogous to reverse Polish notation data on stack and operation. 



Imagine earning one cent for every minute of game playing from one single player. Use Smashlet to reprogram everything. It is like Mr Smith in Matrix. Quite literally. 

New concept of user, interactions with apps, one command at a time.

Conventional notion of Programming is to write a new and independent program. Smashlet is to write a one liner, a list of words. ID-less messaging (IDLM) defines relationships of Smashlet to other smahslets on same or different devices.





Barriers of entry for learning Programming. Set up Python in Windows?

Python turtle?

Expand JavaScript and Java Android Phos? 


Use Lego as analogy for reverse Polish notation -- it can represent anything, fundamental of both lego and rpn is graph theory.
