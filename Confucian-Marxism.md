### ID-less Shellet Programming and Confucian-Marxism

The collapse of the Soviet Union coincided with the rise of GNU Linux Free Software Movement, as well as the rapid growth of China, catching up with America, with its presidents too distracted until the former became too big to kill.

In the mean time, although the computing industry literally created hundreds of millions of jobs, air-lifting many developing countries into modernity, the industry itself introduced another type of class struggle, ageism, which is not obvious in other industries due to their relative maturity and slow change.

Although one may claim that ageism in the computing industry is primarily due to rapid developments in novel programming languages and "frameworks", we introduce a Forth like stack machine shell (Smashlet or Shellet) that can be implemented in any known programming language, at the cost of about the equivalent of 20 lines of JavaScript code, thus providing an almost universal solution to ageism within the industry.
